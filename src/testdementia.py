Alzheimers_Disease = {
     "definition":""" "Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, 
					 eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with Alzheimer’s, symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. 
					 Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults." """,
	"diagnosis":"""  "Ask the person and a family member or friend questions about overall health, past medical problems, ability to carry out 
				     daily activities, and changes in behavior and personality,
				     Conduct tests of memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language,
				     Carry out standard medical tests, such as blood and urine tests, to identify other possible causes of the problem,
				     Perform brain scans, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET), 
				     to rule out other possible causes for symptoms." """,
	"symptons":"""  "The symptoms of Alzheimer's vary from person to person. For many, decline in non-memory aspects of cognition, such as 
				    word-finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment, may signal the very early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. 
				    Researchers are studying biomarkers (biological signs of disease found in brain images, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) to see if 
				    they can detect early changes in the brains of people with MCI and in cognitively normal people who may be at greater risk for 
				    Alzheimer’s. Studies indicate that such early detection may be possible, but more research is needed before these techniques can be 
				    relied upon to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in everyday medical practice." """,
"Types_of_Alzheimers":""" "Mild Alzheimer's Disease people experience greater memory loss and other cognitive difficulties. Problems can 
				    include wandering and getting lost, trouble handling money and paying bills, repeating questions, taking longer to complete normal 
				    daily tasks, and personality and behavior changes. People are often diagnosed in this stage.,
				    Moderate Alzheimer's Disease damage occurs in areas of the brain that control language, reasoning, sensory processing, 
				    and conscious thought. Memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people begin to have problems recognizing family and friends. 
				    They may be unable to learn new things, carry out multistep tasks such as getting dressed, or cope with new situations.
				    People at this stage may have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia and may behave impulsively.
				    Severe Alzheimer's Disease plaques and tangles spread throughout the brain, and brain tissue shrinks significantly. People with 
				    severe Alzheimer’s cannot communicate and are completely dependent on others for their care. Near the end, the person may be in 
				    bed most or all of the time as the body shuts down." """,
	"treatments":""" "No treatment is available to slow or stop Alzheimer’s disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has pproved five drugs that 
					temporarily improve symptoms. The effectiveness of these drugs varies available today alters the underlying course of this terminal disease. 
					Researchers around world are studying dozens of treatment strategies that may have the potential to change the course of the disease." """
