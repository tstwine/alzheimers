   "onset":""" "The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease is advancing age, but Alzheimer’s is not a normal part of aging. 
			    Most people with Alzheimer’s disease are diagnosed at age 65 or older. These individuals are said to have late-onset
			    Alzheimer's disease. When Alzheimer’s develops in a person younger than age 65, it is referred to as “youngeronset”
			    (or “early-onset”) Alzheimer’s." """,

 "family_history":""" "Individuals who have a parent, brother or sister with Alzheimer’s are more likely to develop the disease than
					   those who do not have a first-degree relative with Alzheimer’s. Those who have more than one first-degree relative 
					   with Alzheimer’s are at even higher risk of developing the disease. When diseases run in families, heredity 
					  (genetics), shared environmental/lifestyle factors or both may play a role." """,

"active_management":""" "Active management includes appropriate use of available treatment options, effective management of coexisting 
						 conditions, coordination of care among physicians, other health care professionals and lay caregivers, 
						 participation in activities and adult day care programs and taking part in support groups and supportive 
						 services such as counseling." """,
	"gender":"""   "More women than men have Alzheimer’s disease and ther dementias. Almost two-thirds of Americans with 
					Alzheimer’s are women. Of the 5.2 million people over age 65 with Alzheimer’s in the United States,
					3.4 million are women and 1.8 million are men. Sixteen percent of women age 71 and older have Alzheimer's
					disease or other dementias compared with 11 percent of men. The larger proportion of older women who have
					Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias is primarily explained by the fact that women live longer on
					average than men. Many studies of the age specific incidence (development of new cases) of Alzheimer’s 
					disease or any dementia have found no significant difference by gender. Thus, women are not more likely than 
					   men to develop dementia at any given age" """,
   "education":"""  "People with fewer years of education appear to be at higher risk for Alzheimer’s and other dementias than 
					those with more years of education. Prevalence and incidence studies show that having fewer years of 
					education is associated with a greater likelihood of having dementia and a greater risk of developing dementia.
					Some researchers believe that a higher level of education provides a “cognitive reserve” that enables to better
					compensate for changes in the brain that could result in Alzheimer’s or another dementia. However, others believe 
					that the increased risk of dementia among those with lower educational attainment may be explained by other
					factors common to people in lower socioeconomic groups, such as increased risk for disease in general and less
					access to medical care." """,
	"race":"""   "Most people in the United States living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias are non-Hispanic whites, 
				  older African-Americans and Hispanics are proportionately more likely than older whites to have
				  Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias." """,
